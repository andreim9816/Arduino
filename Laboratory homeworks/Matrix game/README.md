# Pong game

Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it horizontaly across the upper or bottom side of the screen. He can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other
